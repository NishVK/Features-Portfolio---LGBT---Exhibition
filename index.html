2017 represented the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality.
Up until 1967 the LGBT+ community lived in fear of imprisonment for simply being in a same sex relationship. The 1967 Sexual Offences Act was one of the first pieces of legislation
to counter this bringing LGBT+ issues to the forefront of the political agenda.  Museums across the UK commemorated the anniversary. Tales From the City is an exhibition hosted by National Museum of Liverpool.

<p>
  Kay Jones curated the exhibition alongside project researcher Matt Exely.
   She explains how the exhibition came about. “We gathered content for the exhibition from various sources from the
    Museum’s collection like objects, images and oral history interviews. We used loaned objects from local community groups and organisations
     as well as stories and objects from individuals from Liverpool’s LGBT community, images from local archives, artworks from local artists a
    and from the Walker Art Gallery, existing film from local film makers and we also commissioned new films.”

Walking into the exhibition you are greeted by a Liver Bird revamped in rainbow colours a nod to the pride flag
    . With Liverpool holding their first pride event in 2010 and it becoming the first City to officially recognise a district as the gay quarters,
    the past decade has seen greater increase in the visibility of Liverpool' LGBT community. Tales from the City exhibition provides a platform
     to reflect the lives and experiences of Liverpool’s LGBT+ community and how it has changed from 1967 to 2017.
     Individual stories are told through a mixture of objects, costume, art, photography, film and oral history interviews.

“An exhibition about Liverpool’s LGBT community has never been done. The exhibition is part of NML’s commitment to diverse representation and builds upon NML’s LGBT work,” explains Jones.

                The exhibition recognises Merseyside’s profound impact on gay pop culture. Merseyside’s Frankie goes to Hollywood blares in the background
                as you make your way across the exhibition. Framed posters and album covers of the band are featured throughout.

              The centerpiece of the exhibition is a red sequined outfit once worn by legendary dj Lavinia a resident performer at the infamous G Bar.
              The lavish extravagant design epitomises the over top exuberant energy felt at Liverpool’s pride parades.

It features a framed copy of APN, a local magazine largely focused towards the gay and lesbian communities of the North West.
 The 1997 edition featured Lily Savage on the front cover, a character created by gat Birkenhead born performer Paul O’Grady.

                However, the exhibition did not shy away from the pain and the prejudice and was unapologetic in its portrayal of LGBT+ struggle.
            </p>

                In the far corner of the exhibition is a framed bottle simply labeled ‘Aids Medication.’ Below this there is archive interview from Liverpool Talks. It features the voice of local Liverpool man  John Harrison.
                 “Gay people were just dying left, right and centre. Old friends of mine who’d gone to London were dying. The Liverpool gay scene was being decimated.
                  “You had scum newspapers like the Sun saying “the gay plague, this is a gay plague. Gays have got it, don’t go anywhere near hay people, don’t let gay people touch you."

              Through its exploration of struggle and self-determination an overwhelming sense of hope is conveyed. By paying tribute to past hardships it acknowledges the huge progress that has been made.

              In the top right corner reads a sign, “Anfied has given violence, racism, foul language and homophobia the boot. Enjoy the game.  Below this is an encased pair of Nike football boots worn by Everton Football Player, Tyias Browning in 2013.
               EFC were the first premiership club to wear rainbow laces as a part of an anti homophobia campaign. Despite the rivalry of the team it showcases their untied front in tackling homophobia.

           “A large scale exhibition in a National Museum hopefully highlights the importance of Liverpool’s LGBT+ community to the city’s history and identity. We want the exhibition to inform, engage and challenge a wide range of visitors,”

          </section>
There are huge political themes underlying much of the exhibition with a strong anti tory undercurrent.<p></p> Many entertainers, performers and gay venues actively campaigned against the Conservative government who had introduced homophobic legislation.
One of the featured pieces is a poster of the club’s drag performers, Lady Seanne. In the background lays a sign reading ‘Vote Gay Not Grey’ making reference to John Major, Prime Minister at that who was labelled the ‘grey man’ in the media.
<p></p>
Alongside exhibitions the museum works to further fairness and equality.  “We have recently introduced some gender neutral toilets and provide LGBT+ staff training to coincide with exhibitions. For the first time museum staff marched in Liverpool Pride 2017 with an National Museums Liverpool Pride banner,” explains Jones.
“At the Museum of Liverpool we are a hub for LGBT History Month and run a programme of talks and events every February. We were also the venue for the National launch of LGBT History Month in November 2017.”
           <p></p>
Jones added: “We will continue to integrate LGBT+ representation into our temporary exhibitions, permanent displays, collections and education programme.”
           <p></p>
The exhibition ends with a comment section asking  “Who is your Liverpool LGBT icon and why?”  Reading through the post it notes you are overwhelmed with anecdotes and dedications to partners, friends and family.
 <p></p>It is touching end to this powerful exhibition.
 <p></p>Tales From the City is on at Museum of Liverpool and runs until October 2018.
